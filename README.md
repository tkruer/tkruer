### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Tyler Kruer, currently pursuing my bachelor's degree majoring in Public Health from [Arizona State Universtiy](https://asu.edu/). While my dream goal is to become a physician and continue research in mobile health, I am a self taught developer in my free time. 

My exploration of software development orignally began with friends of mine who were using web automation tools like puppeteer in order to purchase limited Nike shoes. Fast forward a few years and my skills include utilizing tools within Python, JavaScript, and Swift in order to solve problems in Mobile Health.

I am a tech enthusiast & an open-source advocate. While most of my automation work is under private repositories, I am always open to collaborating on projects and innovative/disruptive ideas.
